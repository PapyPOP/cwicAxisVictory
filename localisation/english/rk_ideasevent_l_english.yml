This will surely be unpopular and hated amongst the Italian populace. While we could just go ahead and prepare the plan, our old friend Benito Mussolini is in custody and awaiting trials. It might be naive but we could install him as a puppet leader of the Italian Social Republic. This is highly unpopular in the Reichstag as the parliament wanted him gone. However with him in place, even though the Italian people despised him for their defeat it could at the very least create a sense of stability. It is up to the Fuhrer if he wants to directly create a new Reichskommissariat or give his old friend a chance, though in shame."

The SS has already began consolidating their control in the region and are now seeking legitimacy from Berlin. With shifting politics in Berlin, this would only complicates the already controversial situation. If we were to allow the formation, it would not only strengthen the Schutzstaffel like never seen before but also allows the SS to slowly shift away from the Reich and maybe even have the capabilities to influence global events. Disagreeing to their terms might drastically reduce the loyalty of the Schutzstaffel to the Reich. We are on borrowed time and it is time to finally decide the future of Burgundy."

Amidst the confusion, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler quickly barges in and told everyone to lower their guns. Himmler nervously approached the man and began asking questions. It seems like Himmler knew this man. Surprisingly, the man answered. He claimed that he was sent to Berlin by a man known as the Great Leader. He stated that the Great Leader demands the German Reich hand over the Attu Island. 'Wait, Attu Island? But why, the Fuhrer asked'. The man kept his silence. Out of options, the Fuhrer gave the green light to the man. He smiled and walked out of the room, never to be seen again. After the commotion, the Fuhrer arranged a meeting with Heinrich Himmler.

However thanks to our superiority in force and strength, the resistance stood no chance. We were able to secure the town a few hours later. The casualty numbers for our side are 51 men while they suffered 217 casualties, mostly dead.

At this point the crew was about to give up and go back to Lhasa when all of a sudden one of them shouted 'There's a cavern down here!'. Everybody quickly gathered around the man and what they saw was stunning to say the least. A massive entrance which leads to a cavern. 'Could this be the resting place of Noah's Ark?' they wondered. One of them volunteered to go down the small entrance, with the help of a rope. As he descends below equipped with a camera and a torch, he reports the situation to his fellow crewmates. The rope was barely long enough but he made it. There he wandered around the dark cavern searching for something. At last, he found an ancient mural painting that closely resembles the one in Germany. As he looked on in awe, he noticed something. There's another entrance. It seems thought that it is blocked by a boulder. Realising there's nothing left, he quickly took pictures of the mural and called out to his crewmates to pick him up. After he ascended, he told his crewmates about what's down there. Surprised, they asked for the pictures he took. When they took a look, they were stunned. This is it. It must be. The guy then told the crewmates there's another entrance but it is blocked by a boulder. Thankfully, they brought a couple of explosives along with them."

Everybody looked at each other to see if someone dares to go in. But in the end everyone agreed to go in at the same time. Upon entering, they found a staircase which leads to a seemingly endless dark path. Cautiously descending, they began to wonder what could be down there. After 10 minutes, the staircase stopped and led to a pitch-black path. They pressed on and continue walking down the path until all of a sudden a glimpse of light shines. Confused, they slowly walked. At last, it wasn't the Noah's Ark that was shining. IT IS THE FUCKING HOLLOW EARTH. HOW THE FUCK IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE MEIN GOTT!!!

It came as a shock to the whole nation as it battles with itself after their defeat in the Great Patriotic War. \nThe likely cause of death is to be thought an assassination, due to a couple of evidences found nearby. However, there is still no suspect(s) according to the investigators. Foreign observers pointed at the possibility of a planned assassination by the government itself, seeing the leader as incompetent and unfit. \nNevertheless, the nation mourned the loss in a ceremonial funeral."

Japan has always had an interest in the region. This could be seen from their occupation of Vladivostok in the Russian Civil War, where shopkeepers and traders from Japan were brought there up until the end of the conflict. \nInterestingly, there were little to no fighting during the course of the invasion. This could be attributed to the ongoing unrest in Russia, which denied the Russian Army to respond effectively. \nSverdlovsk heavily condemned the invasion, though did not declare a proclamation of war."

This has caused a massive uproar amongst the population, causing a massive collapse which destroyed Russia. \nA new communist government was formed in Kazan by Georgy Zhukov in hopes of "liberating their homelands for the future of mankind".
