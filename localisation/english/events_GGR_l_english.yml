Rebuilding Berlin was part of his vision for Germany's future after the planned victory in World War II. Hitler was familiar with the plans of many foreign buildings in the various capitals of the world, especially Paris and Vienna. He wanted to see Berlin endowed with such buildings, but bigger and according to its own aesthetic. Berlin was to have grand, iconic buildings that testified to Germany's power and reflected the National Socialist worldview. From this point of view, political, military, administrative and economic buildings were planned, but on the other hand no Christian religious buildings. Evoking one of the main buildings of Germania, the future palace of the Führer, Hitler justified the grandiose character of the project by political motivations, namely to give his successors the means of a great policy in spite of the foreseeable personal weaknesses of some of them; between them ; he himself had no need for such pageantry, but it would be useful to the führers of future times. He thus affirmed to his architect. Those who will succeed me one day, those will very much need such pageantry. For many of them, this will be the only way to sustain themselves. One cannot believe the power that a little mind acquires over his contemporaries when he can take advantage of such a staging. Such places, when they are imbued with a historic past, even elevate a successor without stature to a historic rank. See, that's why we have to build all of this in my lifetime; so that I have lived there and my spirit bestows a tradition on this building. Hitler finally justified his architectural projects by the desire to provide the regime with its own buildings; he found it absurd and undignified that republican governments moved into former princely, royal or imperial residences and did not construct new buildings."
